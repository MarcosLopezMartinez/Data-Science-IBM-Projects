# Data-Science-IBM-Projects

This repository is for all projects carried out in the IBM Data Science Course.

# Aclaration:
The format of the projects can be a little confusing. All projects are made up of a series of tasks that I must complete and after these is the code that solves these tasks. Each and every one of the answers are my own, executed according to what I have learned in each module of the course.
